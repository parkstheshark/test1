Designing resilient architectures:


Computing and Networking:
I saw a lot of emphasis on high availability and how to incorporate it into your designs.
There were queries about VPN and Direct Connect’s high availability, but also about their performance and how to set them up, as well as how to configure them.
As a result, it is critical to understand the distinctions between interface and gateway endpoints, as well as how to leverage both in your designs, in order to get the most out of VPC endpoints.


Migration, Storage, and Databases:
familiarize yourself with the various S3 storage classes and how they are best used in certain applications.
We may utilize S3 Transfer Acceleration, Cross-Region Replication, or CloudFront with S3 for worldwide high availability.
on’t forget to familiarize yourself with the architectural differences between RDS and Aurora database instances. Also, I’ve seen that DynamoDB performance and DynamoDB streams have gotten a lot more attention.


Scalability and High availability:
Route 53 latency and integration with other services are also critical considerations.


Application services:
AWS installations and hybrid settings.
It’s important that you understand SQS at a high level and realize that SQS is a wonderful tool for decoupling architectures (meaning that your designs are not dependent on each other).
SQS and Kinesis is key since I had a difficult inquiry about the two and how they may function together. 


Logging and Security:
Cost optimization, security, and Aurora/FSx/AWS architecture
Understanding AWS Key Management System (KMS) and its compliance requirements are important since there was a lot more of it

portugal surf spots

Foz de Lizandro (surf camp spot, mellow crowd, easier reef break)

Baleal (beach break, dont accidentally surf the crowded spot, little north of lisbon) begineer friendly

Almagreira (beach break, mostly locals so be humble) Dont go out if heavy or after big rain

Praia do Baleal is a fantastically flexible, crescent shaped beach that curves towards the town. Cantinho Da Baia - 'corner of the bay' is an area that comes to life in a big northerly, or medium sized northwesterly swell (good when smaller)

I don't think we have a document describing what they do, but the E2 scripts are a way to:
Activate a new CDC/Core (and deprecate an old one)
Update the "supported minimum CDA"
Update the deployed CDG tag

Jack/John might've added more functionality, so maybe reach out to one of them on the high side to verify.

 
also used to update the deployed CDA tag in our customer facing (cloud based) nexus repo
